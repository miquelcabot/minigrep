# minigrep

## Description

`minigrep` is a simple command-line application that mimics some functionality of the Unix `grep` command. It allows users to search for a specific string in a file and prints the lines that contain the string.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miquelcabot/minigrep.git
cd minigrep
```

## Usage
To use `minigrep`, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run:

```bash
cargo run <query> <filename>
```

Replace `<query>` with the string you want to search for and `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to search in.
